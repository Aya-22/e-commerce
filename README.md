# e-commerce

## The main focus of this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code.

The first step taken was to create the database using sql. After creating the database, I created  different tables that were linked with primary and foreign keys. I did include seeds for each table, the seeds canbe seen when the app is deployed in Insomnia. Then I installed the npm package and once the packages were installed I worked on framework for each api, as we learned in class earlier in the week. Reviewing the past activities was really helpful with this homework assignment. I worked on the get, post, and delete functions for the server.
